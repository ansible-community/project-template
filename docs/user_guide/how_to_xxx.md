# Completing a project use case

note to developer - your project user guide likely has multiple .md files.
Each file should cover one major use case or 'user story' for your project.
The optimal outline is shown below.

## Understanding xxx

note to developer - this is where you describe what XXX is and why a user
would care. What problem does it solve for them, etc. This is an 
[explanation section](https://diataxis.fr/explanation/).

## How to xxx

note to developer -you can change the heading but this section is a 
[procedure](https://diataxis.fr/how-to-guides/) that shows the exact steps to
 achieve something. It should be a numbered set of steps.

1. Do this.

```
cli example, yaml example etc
```

2. Do this other thing.

3. Verify this thing.
