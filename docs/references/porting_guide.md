# PROJECTNAME $version Porting guide

note to developer - consider autogenerating this using 
[antsibull-changelog](https://pypi.org/project/antsibull-changelog/).  
If you manually create this, it should include all information a user needs to
migrate from one version of your project to another, plus all the new features
 and changes. 
 The porting guide should link to the release changelogs as well.
